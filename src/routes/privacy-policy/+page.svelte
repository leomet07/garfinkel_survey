            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organizational security measures designed to protect the security of

        </ol>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
            setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
            have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
            other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
            be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
            we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
            in a revised version of this privacy notice.
