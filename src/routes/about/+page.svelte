		<h1>About The Spectator Demographics Survey</h1>
		<p>
			This survey aims to collect far more detailed information about the
			demographics of the Stuyvesant student body than other surveys, like
			the yearly incoming Freshman survey by The Spectator and the
			NYCDOE's enrollment data, have in the past.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Privacy</h2>
			<p>
				This survey is optional, but highly encouraged, for all
				Stuyvesant students.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ancestry question response data is only revealed to the public
				anonymously in bulk with other students. All other information
				is private.
